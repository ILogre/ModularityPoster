\begin{abstract}
This paper provides a overview of the sensor data visualization requirements in
terms of software engineering. The first chapter defines our context of work
through a short definition of this field, a clarification about the aim and the
efforts to achieve it and several exiting way to implement a visualization solution.
The second chapter raises the challenges relatively to software engineering,
detailing properties to observe while contributing to this particular field.
Then, the third chapter briefly offers some perspectives to tackle those challenges.

Introduction

\section{Sensor data visualization}
Sentence to introduce this chapter

\subsection{What is sensor data visualization ?}
Definition of sensor data visualization.
		Data visualization through dashboards (def)
		What kind of visualizations ?
		For what kind of data ?
		For what purposes ?

\subsection{How to achieve it ?}
Abstract description of the task to perform
Lots of methodologies, but need to chose visualizations to apply to refined data sets in order to achieve some final goal
		-> several challenges
		define what is the information the dashboard should help understanding
		prepare data to be visualize
		chose visualization for each group of data
		fill the visualization with the well formatted data set
		arrange the visualisations into a (multiple) dashboard
		audit the dashboard according to the initial motivation

\subsection{How to implement it}
		Those challenges refer to three different domains :
			Requirement Engineering
			Data traitement
			Dashboard design
		Existing : SQL...
		One other way to tackle it is to design one DSL per domain
This way, one, when in charge of a given domain, may deal with a language
specifically designed for his task, without being polluted by others
vocabulary or domain constraints.
%/!\ à traiter par domaine ou par "démarche"

\section{Properties to satisfy and associated challenges}
Sentence to introduce this chapter

\subsection{Evolutivity}
Data visualization is a growing, fast evolving field, as well as requirement engineering is an active research field offering new way to capture needs.
For those reasons, their respective DSL will have to evolve in time, the composition should therefore take this fact into consideration to ease the evolutivity of the whole composed dashboard design framework.

\subsection{Isolation}
\subsection{Low coupling}
\subsection{Integrity}

\section{Actionable insights}
\subsection{DSL composition}
		Aggregation
		Fusion/Merge
		Integration
