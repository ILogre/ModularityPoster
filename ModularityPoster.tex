\begin{abstract}
  %% Problem
  Connected objects and other monitoring systems continuously produce
  data about their environment. Dashboards are then designed to
  aggregate and present data to end-users.
  %% Contribution
  Technologies used to design and implement visualization dashboards
  are babbling from a software engineering point of view. This paper
  highlights how this domain could benefit from leveraging separation
  of concerns and software composition paradigms.
  %% Results
  % It describes how the design of dashboard visualizing data
  % collected from sensors triggers multiple challenges about software
  % composition through separation of concern and modularity in order to
  % insure properties on the design process.

\section{Introduction}
The increase of data producing objects leads to a growing need to
interpret those data in order to extract knowledge. When there is a
human at the end of the production chain, the result must allow her to
exploit it, so being adapted to his capabilities. Such visualization
are used to assist one to make a decision according to a projection of
facts, as are sensed data. Visualization is a way to allow a human to
induce information from raw data through dashboards. The first chapter
defines our context of work through a short definition of this field,
a clarification about the aim and the efforts to achieve it and
several exiting way to implement a visualization solution. The second
chapter raises the challenges relatively to software engineering,
detailing properties to observe while contributing to this particular
field. Then, the third chapter briefly offers some perspectives to
tackle those challenges.

\section{Visualization Dashboards}
% une colonne max.
\mypar{Process overview}
% Qui sont les roles intervenants?
In order to design such visualization dashboard, there is a need to chose
visualizations to apply to refined datasets in order to achieve some
identified final goal. This task is to be performed by three roles :
\begin{enumerate}
\item a Requirement Engineer (RE),
\item a Data Manager (DM),
\item  a Dashboard Designer (DD).
\end{enumerate}
% Quels sont leurs domaines de competences?
Each role is responsible for several tasks:
(i) the RE define what will be the purpose of the dashboard and audit the
resulting dashboard according to the initial motivation,
(ii) the DM select data to be visualize and treat it in order to provide
the needed well formatted datasets,
(iii) the DD chose visualization for each group of data and arrange them
spatially into a dashboard.
% Pourquoi ces competences sont souvent des acteurs differents et pas juste des roles?
Even if those roles collaborates, e.g. the choice of visualization the DD has
to make depends on the purpose exposed by the RE, they relates on distinct
domains of expertise, each one bringing is own challenges, therefore each role
is usually impersonated by a dedicated stakeholder.
\mypar{Designing dashboard}
%\begin{enumerate}
% Quels sont les outils a dispositions (UML, CTT)
One could use existing solutions to implement each of the mentioned tasks, for
example using SQL would be a suitable choice to store and refine
sensor data, IFML to model the wanted organization of the dashboard
and temporal logic or CTT to define the aimed product and succession of action
to be performed with it.
% Quels sont les problemes quand on les utilise?
However, those tools are not designed for the visualization field and reveal a
lack of expressivity being too generic, as CTT which offers no solution about
characterization of visualization need.
% Est-ce qu'on sort certains experts de leur domaine de competences avec ces outils?
Moreover, there is a lack of interoperability between those tools due to the
distinct field they come from. This results in a difficulty for the stakeholders
to dialogue and converge toward a solution when a compromise is needed.
%\end{enumerate}

\mypar{Implementing dashboard}

% Quels sont les outils a dispositions (Web, bibliotheques)
To implement the dashboard, one can use on-line visualization widget libraries,
either professional solution as HighChart and AmChart or community-based example
as D3.JS, and add HTML5 code to structure the result.
% Quels sont les problemes quand on les utilise?
However, those widgets does not allows integrability with a lot of data format,
since the development effort is put on the interaction more instead of the interoperability.
Also, the huge amount of available widgets, e.g. D3.js offers 235 widgets on
January 2015, increase the difficulty to choose a suitable visualization,
% Est-ce qu'on sort certains experts de leur domaine de competences avec ces outils?
due to the lack of effort in categorization of those new visualization capabilities.
Those last two points strengthen the difficulty to cooperate with other domains
because of the gap between the conceptual role of the RE and the implementation
role of the DD, and because of the incompatible constraints impose by libraries
on data format which reduce re-usability.


\section{Challenges}

The previous section described how people support the design and
implementation of dashboards using both state of the art and state of
practice methods. We highlight in this section four challenges
triggered by such approach, and discuss how separation of concerns and
software composition could be helpful to support this process.

%% Pour chaque paragraphe, se raccrocher au contexte de la section
%% d'avant (je ne peux pas le faire tant que c'est aps ecrit),
%% identifier le probleme du point de vue ou de la separation ou de la
%% composition (ou des deux), et discuter des benefics envisages par
%% une approche de ce genre.

\mypar{Evolutivity}
Data visualization is a growing, fast evolving field, as well as
requirement engineering is an active research field offering new way
to capture needs.  For those reasons, their respective DSL will have
to evolve in time, the composition should therefore take this fact
into consideration to ease the evolutivity of the whole composed
dashboard design framework.

\mypar{Isolation}
Each domain expert (i.e. user of a solution specific to a domain)
should be able to work in isolation from the other domains. This means
that one can always contribute in her own domain, to improve her
contribution, and being able to check that this evolution is
consistent in this domain, even if the other domains are in an
unstable or incoherent state.

\mypar{Low coupling}
The number of hypothesis made in a domain implementation to the others
should be as small as possible. In addition to be a good software
development practice, this criteria eases the replacement of solution
by an other one, e.g. of the data management by a visualization
resource DSL.

\section{Conclusions}

%% Un petit paragraphe de conclusions/

%% Ouvrir sur la compo de DSL
\mypar{Actionable insights: DSL composition}
One interesting way to tackle those challenges would be to design a
DSL for each of the three domains mentioned in \ref{subsec:How to
  implement it} and then to compose those partial results in a overall
data visualization solution.
The state of the art reveals two main ways to manage this composition :\\
\iitem{i} Fusion/Merge, i.e. the operation to produce one bigger meta
model from several meta models by identification of a pivot and
merging from it, and
then refine the associated concrete syntaxes to produce a global one. (insert ref)\\
\iitem{ii} Aggregation, i.e. make enough assumptions about the meta models to be able to link them through the transformation of several meta models by adding, deleting or editing specific model elements, essentially to align two concepts from different domains or to reference an external concept in order to delegate part of the responsibilities. (insert ref)\\
The authors short-term perspective is to work on the integration of
the DSLs as software services in order to be able to compose languages
while insuring the same properties as service-oriented architecture
field.
